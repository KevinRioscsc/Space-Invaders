SPACE INVADERS

My simple take on Space Invaders using ES6 JS for practice

*This is not the final version

Bugs:
 .Ship lives are not working and will be fixed 
 .There is no way to reset the game after winning or losing
 
Implementation that want to be implement:
 . I want to add powerups because I want it to be my take on space invaders and I want to add cool powerups that make sense
 . I want to add a skill gap and make the game increasingly hard level by level
 . I want to add a scoreboard and more levels
 . I could add a backend with mongoDB and express.js for leaderboards, so users can track their score
 . Audio is something thatll be implemented
 
 For now this is only the base space invader with only one level because I'm currently working on a App
 
 Hope You Enjoy!
